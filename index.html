<p>The Island is in Eastern time zone. 
    It broke off the coast of Florida since Hurricane Ian damaged the lands.  There are many cats on the island and they are fast and furious... </p>

<p>This island is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. The weather is sunny but we do have a volcano erruption every couple months.  
    Luckily, it is just small eruptions that help fertilize the lands. 
    The lands feature a roster of all types of animals. 
    Some are even endangered animals. </p>
